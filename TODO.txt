- Display paychecks
    The problem is when an account hasn't a paycheck.
    It will output nothing
    I don't know how to send a message of empty (There is no paychecks) because I can't verify if rs.begin() == rs.end()
    It's a bug with soci.

    For the rest, there's no bug

/**
*TO DO
*/
- Delete pay doesn't work in the DB

- ID pay should be restart at 1 for each account
    Ex: If there's 2 pays in account 1, on don't want that the first pay of the account 2 has id 3.

- Clean the code
- Clean github
